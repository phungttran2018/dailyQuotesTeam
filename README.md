Description: We were attending Hackathon with an intention to learn and enjoy the workshops from different companies. However, after we listened to Miri from Microsoft talk about spreading good stories to influence people around. We both got so inspired that we decided to create a webapp from scratch. This web is really simple. Each day, it will randomize a positive quote from our database. Not only that, it has a text box that allow user to input their thoughts, sadness, frustration....the moment. There is another text field that allow users to read the most recent comments from people. Here is an absolutely cool feature about this web. You can say everything you like without anyone know who you are. It is completely anonymous and not require any login at all.
